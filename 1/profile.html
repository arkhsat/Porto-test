        <h3>Software Developer</h3>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>As a software developer, I have a passion for building 
                innovative solutions that solve complex problems. With 
                a strong foundation in computer science and a keen eye 
                for detail, I am able to develop high-quality software 
                that meets the needs of my clients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, 
                from small-scale applications to large-scale systems. 
                I am experienced in a range of programming languages and 
                technologies, including Java, Python, and React. I am also 
                well-versed in agile development methodologies and am comfortable 
                working in a team environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always eager to learn new technologies and keep up with the latest 
                trends in software development. I am a quick learner and am able to adapt 
                to new challenges and environments. I am also a strong communicator and am 
                able to explain complex technical concepts in a way that is easy for non-technical 
                stakeholders to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to continue my career as a software developer and am always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn.
